```bash
# If using Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod

# Or push to GitHub and let Netlify auto-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready"
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Verify lesson pages load correctly
- [ ] Test dynamic lesson routing
- [ ] Verify 404 page for invalid routes
- [ ] Test back/forward browser navigation

#### Bot Functionality
- [ ] Test main Interactive Bot
- [ ] Test lesson-specific bots
- [ ] Verify autofocus on input fields
- [ ] Test message sending and receiving
- [ ] Verify bot response formatting
- [ ] Check special characters are removed
- [ ] Test error handling for failed API calls

#### Responsive Design
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

- [ ] Test on desktop
- [ ] Verify sidebar behavior on mobile
- [ ] Test chat interface on all screen sizes

#### Performance
- [ ] Check page load times
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Test with slow 3G connection
- [ ] Verify images and assets load
- [ ] Check for memory leaks (long sessions)

## Environment Variables

No environment variables required for production. API URL is hardcoded.

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Users need to login twice
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Solution:** Login now uses useEffect to watch authentication state

### Issue: Bot responses have ** characters
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Solution:** formatBotResponse removes all markdown characters

### Issue: Lesson pages missing
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Solution:** DynamicLesson component handles API-loaded lessons

### Issue: Lesson sidebar always expanded
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Solution:** Default state set to collapsed

## Monitoring

### What to Monitor
1. **API Response Times** - Check Render.com dashboard
2. **Error Rates** - Check browser console in production
3. **User Authentication** - Monitor login/signup success rates
4. **Bot Functionality** - Verify chat responses are working

### Debugging in Production
- Console logs are enabled for API calls (prefixed with [API])
- Error boundary catches and displays React errors
- Network tab shows all API requests/responses

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous Netlify deployment
2. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors
3. Verify API backend is running on Render.com
4. Test locally with production API URL

## Success Criteria

✅ All users can signup and login successfully
✅ Protected routes are accessible after authentication
✅ All lesson pages display correctly
✅ Bot responds to messages with formatted text
✅ No console errors in production
✅ Responsive on all devices
✅ Fast load times (<3 seconds)
